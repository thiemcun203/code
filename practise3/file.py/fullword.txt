people plan for the future so they have
more control over their lives. I believe that
saving money helps people to become more
independent because they will not have to
ask for financial help when they are old.
In addition, they can plan for things like
their children's education or buying a bigger
house. However, people with little money
cannot plan for the future easily because
they have to focus on the present. Some
people argue that having less money does
not prevent people planning for the future,
but, in my view, it makes it much more
difficult.
